# üìå Are Non-Playable Prompts (NPPs) Real Today?

**Yes ‚Äî Non-Playable Prompts (NPPs) already exist in practice across many modern AI systems, even if not explicitly named that way.** The term NPP provides a formal definition for a common but hidden layer of prompt engineering used to guide and constrain AI behavior.

## ‚úÖ Real-World Examples of NPPs

### 1. System Prompts in LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
Hidden default prompts like:  
> "You are a helpful, harmless, and honest assistant."

Invisible to the user, uneditable ‚Äî classic NPPs.

### 2. Behavior and Tone Control in Enterprise AI Assistants
Internal constraints that enforce corporate tone, suppress topics, or restrict legal/medical advice.  
‚Üí Non-editable but shapes all outputs.

### 3. Prompt Injection by Image Generators (e.g., Midjourney, DALL¬∑E)
Augmenting user prompts internally with quality/style modifiers like:  
> "studio lighting, detailed, cinematic"

Hidden layer steering output.

### 4. Long-context and Memory Layers in LLMs
Internal histories or summaries influencing outputs without user control.  
‚Üí Persistently active NPPs.

## üß† Why NPPs Matter

- They **exist but lack visibility** or formal recognition.
- This concept gives the community **a framework** to identify, document, and design with NPPs in mind.
- Could lead to **auditable architectures**, separating user input from system-level intent and hidden influence.
