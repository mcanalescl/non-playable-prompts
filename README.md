# Non-Playable Prompt (NPP)

**Non-Playable Prompt (NPP)** is a concept introduced by [Marcelo Canales](https://github.com/mcanalescl) to define a class of prompts or contextual inputs that influence the behavior of AI systems, game environments, or narrative engines without being directly triggered, visible, or editable by the end user.

## üß† Definition

A **Non-Playable Prompt (NPP)** is a system-level instruction or background input that:

- Is **not visible or editable** by the user.
- **Does not expect** a direct response.
- Serves a **regulatory, tonal, or environmental function**.
- Influences the behavior, tone, or context of the system **implicitly**.

## üîç Key Characteristics

| Prompt Type            | Visible to User | Editable | Triggers Response | Example                                          |
|------------------------|-----------------|----------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| User Prompt            | Yes             | Yes      | Yes               | "What is photosynthesis?"                        |
| System Prompt          | No              | No       | Indirectly        | "You are a helpful assistant."                   |
| **Non-Playable Prompt**| No (or partial) | No       | Not necessarily   | "Maintain an academic tone throughout all texts" |

## üîß Applications

- **AI Prompt Engineering**: Reinforcing tone, safety, or ethical constraints.
- **Game Design**: Hidden logic that controls NPC behavior or environmental reactions.
- **Narrative Systems**: Background storytelling constraints that guide style, genre, or moral framework.
- **Multi-agent AI Systems**: Internal rules passed as context between agents to modulate behavior.
