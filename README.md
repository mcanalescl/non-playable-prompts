# Non-Playable Prompt (NPP)

**Non-Playable Prompt (NPP)** is a concept introduced by [Marcelo Canales](https://github.com/mcanalescl) to describe a class of prompts or inputs that influence the behavior of AI systems, narrative engines, or game environments without being directly editable or triggered by the end user.

## 🧠 Definition

A **Non-Playable Prompt** is a prompt that:
- Is **not visible or editable by the user**.
- Does **not expect a direct response**.
- Serves a **regulatory, tonal, or environmental role** within a system.
- Is often used to **steer behavior, tone, or context** internally.

## 🔍 Examples

- System-level instructions in language models.
- Internal narrative parameters in generative storytelling engines.
- Non-user-configurable NPC behavior patterns in video games.
- Hidden tone controllers in prompt engineering chains.

See [`examples.md`](./examples.md) for more details.

## 🔧 Applications

- **AI Prompt Engineering**: Aligning model behavior without user control.
- **Game Design**: Invisible narrative or logic constraints.
- **Story Engines**: Controlling style, genre, or moral themes without explicit prompts.
